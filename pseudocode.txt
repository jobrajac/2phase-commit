Classes:
TaskManager_Old - TM
ResourceManager A and B

Two-phase commit does not guarantee that a distributed transaction can't fail, but it does guarantee that it can't fail without the TM being aware of it.

Prepare-phase (voting phase):
    The TM attempts to prepare A and B for either committing or aborting the transaction.
    If A and B can guarantee that the transition can complete in any circumstance, they vote yes (send yes to the TM), else they are voting no.
    A and B should have stored the request locally in case of a shutdown or other errors. (Maybe attempt to execute, and rollback if voting fails? Not sure).

Commit-phase:
    If both A and B have voted yes, the TM sends out a new message to A and B requesting them to commit the transaction.
